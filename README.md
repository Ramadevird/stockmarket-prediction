Title: Stock Market Prediction using Deep Learning Techniques

Description:
During my Corizo internship, I completed a stock market prediction project utilizing deep learning techniques. Specifically, I implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. This advanced architecture allowed me to effectively capture temporal dependencies in the stock market data, enhancing the prediction accuracy. The project encompassed data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and visualization. By showcasing my expertise in applying deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis, this project demonstrates my proficiency in leveraging cutting-edge techniques to make accurate predictions in dynamic financial markets.
